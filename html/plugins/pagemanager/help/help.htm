<h1>Pagemanager_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../pagemanager.png" style="display:block; float:left">
<p>Pagemanager_XH simplifies the administration of pages of a
CMSimple_XH installation.
This plugin is comparable to the Menumanager plugin with regard to functionality,
but by using a treeview it allows for better handling of websites with many pages.
With Pagemanager_XH it is also possible to rearrange whole submenus.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation! Support might not be given otherwise.
It's generally a good idea to read the documentation,
<em>before</em> you encounter any problems!</strong></p>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Pagemanager_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH.
It requires a UTF-8 encoded version,
i.e. it's usable from CMSimple_XH 1.2 on. Additionally it requires the
jQuery4CMSimple plugin. This will be already installed in all versions of CMSimple_XH since 1.4.1.
If you have an older version, it's best to download and install
<a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/plugins:jquery4cmsimple">
jQuery4CMSimple</a> before proceeding.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/manuals:users_manual:plugins:installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory pagemanager to your server into the CMSimple_XH plugins directory.</li>
<li>If neccessary set write permissions to the subdirectories css, config und languages.</li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.
Select Pagemanager from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Pagemanager_XH in "Plugin Config".
Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Plugin Language".
You can translate the character strings to your own language,
or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Pagemanager_XH can be customized in "Plugin Stylesheet".
Particularly you should look for the settings that are commented out.
Perhaps you like to try to active these settings.
The currently distributed stylesheet is optimized for the
standard configuration with three menu levels.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<img class="image-right" src="pagemanager.png" alt="Pagemanager_XH screenshot">
<p>This plugin is used exclusively in CMSimple_XH's backend.
It is started by "Select&nbsp;Plugin"&nbsp;> "Pagemanager"&nbsp;> "Page&nbsp;administration".
Now you see a view of your site's structure,
that basically resembles the sitemap.
However, it is possible to open and close page branches in this view,
so you don't loose overview of even extensive websites.
You can open or close those by clicking on the small markers left to the page,
or by double clicking their titles.</p>
<p>Above the tree view of your website's pages you find Pagemanager_XH's <strong>toolbar</strong>.
When hovering over the buttons, popups which describe the tool's function will be shown.
The two leftmost buttons allow to expand resp. collapse the tree view of your website.
The toolbar is particularly useful,
if your browser doesn't allow Pagemanager_XH's context menu to popup.</p>
<p>Rearrangement of the structure of your pages is done by <strong>drag & drop</strong>;
when dragging according markers are shown, so you can see where
the page will be inserted when dropping it.
If it is not possible to drag to a certain page,
because it would result in e.g. a recursive page structure,
or the nesting level would be greater then your configured menu levels,
this will be shown by a red cross
or you will simply be not allowed to drop there.
<em>So carefully watch the markers,</em>
until you get a feeling how the drag&drop works.
If you hold down the CTRL key while dragging,
the result will be a copy instead of a move operation.</p>
<table border="1" style="margin: auto">
<caption><strong>Examples of drag&drop move operations</strong></caption>
<tr><th>during move</th><th>after move</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="move1.png" alt="Move 1"></td><td><img src="result1.png" alt="Result 1"></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="move2.png" alt="Move 2"></td><td><img src="result2.png" alt="Result 2"></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="move3.png" alt="Move 3"></td><td><img src="result3.png" alt="Result 3"></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="move4.png" alt="Move 4"></td><td><img src="result4.png" alt="Result 4"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Additional functionality is available in the toolbar
or through the <strong>context menu</strong>
(click the right mouse button on the page).
You can create new pages, rename or delete existing ones,
and use the common clipboard functions as an alternative to drag & drop.
If a paste operation will result in a recursive page structure,
e.g. by copying a page into itself,
it will be silently ignored, to not annoy you with a warning message.
<em>If you delete the selected page, all it's subpages will be deleted as well.</em></p>
<p>The checkboxes to the left of the pages
allow you to view and change and their <strong>publishing state</strong>.
You can configure if they refer to 'Published?' or 'Show in menu?'.
<strong>Duplicate headings</strong> are shown as in the navigation menu.
If you hover over them with the mouse pointer,
the real page headings will be displayed in a popup.
<strong>Newly created pages</strong> will be shown with a different icon,
to better distinguish them from old pages.</p>
<p>The possiblitly to copy whole substructures might not seam resonable at first sight,
but it could be useful, e.g. if you've got a gallery on those pages,
because all content <em>and</em> meta data of these pages will be copied too.
So it is possible to adjust details afterwards.</p>
<p>Note that there is no undo or cancel functionality.
If you've totally mixed up your page structure
simply refresh your browser's view <em>without</em> saving before.
Your old page structure will be presented again.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>

<h3>Irregular page structures</h3>
<p>It is possible that your existing website has an irregular page structure.
E.g. after an &lt;h1&gt; heading follows immediatly an &lt;h3&gt; heading
without an &lt;h2&gt; heading in between.</p>
<p>You can check the regularity of your page structure 
with Pagemanager_XH. It will warn you of any irregularities
and will let you proceed only, if you explicitly confirm!
If you do not proceed, no harm will be done.</p>
<p>If you don't understand what this is about:
<strong>Consult your webmaster, or get any other support before proceeding
with Pagemanager_XH!</strong></p>
<p>Irregularities in your page structure might have
unintentionally happend while you were editing manually
the page structure in the editor (e.g. changing headings, deleting pages).</p>
<p><strong>But it is possible that this feature is used by your system
for a special purpose.</strong> Perhaps all pages with an &lt;h3&gt; heading are
hidden automatically!
In this case you can't use Pagemanager_XH, because it reorders
your page structure to be regular.
If you nonetheless want to use Pagemanager_XH you have to use other
means (see the Page Tab above the editor) to hide the appropriate pages.
But in any case, if you're not <em>exactly</em> knowing,
if your irregular page structure is intentionally so, consult your webmaster.
<strong>Support will not be given to repair damage in the case of
reorderd structures in the CMSimple forum.</strong></p>
<p>If the page structure of your website is irregular,
and you want to keep it this way, <em>you can't use Pagemanager_XH</em>.
If you've already installed it,
it's best to uninstall it, and to use your current way of manipulating your
page structure. Or, you can have a look at
<a href="http://www.cmsimple-styles.com/cmsimplestyles/?Plugins_%26amp%3B_Tools:Menumanager_Plugin">
Menumanager</a>.</p>

<h3>jQuery</h3>
<p>Pagemanager_XH <em>may</em> not work in installations
with jQuery dependent plugins/addons/templates that
don't use jQuery4CMSimple, but import their own jQuery library.
This won't get fixed (as it's not possible to fix it in all cases),
because all developers are advised to use only jQuery4CMSimple together
with all their jQuery based code for CMSimple_XH.
So offending extensions should be updated!</p>
