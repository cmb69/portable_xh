<h1>Portable_XH</h1>
<p>Portable_XH is a portable CMSimple_XH distribution for Windows that is meant
to run on your local machine without the need to have a webserver with PHP
installed. It requires no installation, runs under a guest account and even from
an USB drive. It doesn't allow access from other computers, particularly from
the internet, so its absolutely fine, when incoming requests are blocked by
your firewall.</p>
<p>Portable_XH is the perfect solution to have a demo of CMSimple_XH at hand, or
to portably prepare a website without uploading it to some webspace in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>The current version is BETA softwareâ€“use with caution!</strong></p>
